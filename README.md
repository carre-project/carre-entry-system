## CARRE Risk Model Semantic Data Entry System v2.0

The Risk Model Semantic Data Entry system was initially developed in order to capture the risk associations identified in D.2.2. 
# 
A custom SPA (single page application) has been developed for CARRE users to assist in populating the RDF repository.
# 
Observables, evidence sources, risk elements and associations can be entered via web forms, and automatically translated to RDF
